# Introduction

This repo provides the codebase described in the blog [Auto-generating HANA ML CAP Artifacts from Python](
https://blogs.sap.com/2023/06/22/auto-generating-hana-ml-cap-artifacts-from-python/)

This contains the following structure
notebooks (For the Data Science code in python)

 For the CAP Full Stack Cloud Application
 This code is proivided mainly for reference as most of the code here is either generated by hana_ml generator from the python notebooks or generated by CAP CDS framework. 
 Only few files have the additional custom code required to make the complete app.
