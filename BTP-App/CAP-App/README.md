# Introduction

This repo provides the codebase described in the blog [Auto-generating HANA ML CAP Artifacts from Python](
https://blogs.sap.com/2023/06/22/auto-generating-hana-ml-cap-artifacts-from-python/)

## Content
This contains the following structure
- notebooks (For the Data Science code in python)

 For the CAP Full Stack Cloud Application
 This code is proivided mainly for reference as most of the code here is either generated by hana_ml generator from the python notebooks or generated by CAP CDS framework. 
 Only few files have the additional custom code required to make the complete app.

The usecase and datasets used here are the same as described in the [FuelPriceForecast](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-ml-samples/tree/main/BTP-App/FuelPriceForecast) project

For help with setting up user with right privileges refer to [Setup](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-ml-samples/tree/main/BTP-App/FuelPriceForecast#readme) from above project

For data loading refer to [Data Load](https://github.com/SAP-samples/hana-ml-samples/blob/main/BTP-App/FuelPriceForecast/notebooks/FuelPricesForecast_DataPreparation.ipynb) from above project

### Customizations 
For each folder here are is the list of files with custom code
- app
    - fiori
        - webapp
            - controller
                - App.controller.js – creation of “global” events to manage the layout that can be used anywhere else on the app
                - PoS_Detail.controller.js
                - PoS_Main.controller.js
            - i18n
                - i18n.properties – Contains internationalization resources for translations
            - models
                - models.js – Create annotation JSON Model to fetch translations from i18n db cds level (not mandatory and can be omitted)
            - view
                - App.view.xml – Add Flexible Column Layout control to wrapper of application
                - PoS_Detail.view.xml
                - PoS_Main.view-xml
            - Component.js – Creation of global and annotations JSON Models (not mandatory and can be omitted)
            - manifest.json – Change the OData service version from 4.0 to 2.0
        - annotations.cds – Creation of UI annotations to define columns to be used by the Smart Controls on the app (Smart Table)
